# FakeGApps

Used in combinaton with [Âµg GmsCore](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore) to enable Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and much more.
This is an Xposed module and such needs LSPosed or compatible installed.
To install, install the APK from the releases section and enable it in LSPosed Manager. You don't need to tick any checkboxes except the already enabled "system frameworks".
